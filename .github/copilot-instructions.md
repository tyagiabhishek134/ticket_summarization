This is a Python project for ticket summarization and Q&A using transformer models. The project uses:
- transformers library for NLP tasks
- Flask for API endpoints
- BART model for summarization
- RoBERTa model for question answering

When suggesting code changes:
1. Ensure proper error handling for API endpoints
2. Follow REST API best practices
3. Consider memory efficiency when loading models
4. Include proper documentation for functions and API endpoints
